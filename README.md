Dungeon Crawler

A Doom-like game that renders to ascii and outputs to terminal!




IMPORTANT:
Make sure the pygame window is focused for input events to be received.

Depending on your terminal font, Renderer.ascii_map may need to be adjusted.

Values stored in textures should range from 0-9.  Values below 5 are
substractive and above 5 are additive.
